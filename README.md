# React-Redux-installer (For Unix)

Small script for lazy react dev:

Comes with following modules:
React, Redux,Router, Axios, Babel, Brunch, Eslint and friends.

And a installerComponent already copied in your app folder (Don't forget to set as executable ``` chmod +x installComponent.sh ```, and then execute it with ``` ./installComponent.sh ```, but if needed you have the file in the repo

Here are the tools that you'll need:
1. Node - npm
2. yarn 
3. Brunch
4. Git
5. Optional: Atom

#### Install process

The lazy way:
  Copy the scrit into your root folder
  Make sure the script is executable by running in the terminal: ``` chmod +x installer.sh ```
  Then run command: ``` ./installer.sh ```
  And follow the installation

You can also copy the file to your /usr/local/bin then you'll be able to run the script from anywhere. (I'm not sure if it is a best practice)

I'm a newbee so the script is really simple and probably holds a lot off error, so feel free to make it better :-)
