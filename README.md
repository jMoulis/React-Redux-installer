# React-Redux-installer

Small script for lazy react dev:

Comes with following modules:
React, Redux,Router, Axios, Babel, Brunch, Eslint and friends.

#### Install process

The lazy way:
  Copy the scrit into your root folder
  Make sure the script is executable by running in the terminal: ``` chmod +x installer.sh ```
  Then run command: ``` ./installer.sh ```
  And follow the installation

You can also copy the file to your /usr/local/bin then you'll be able to run the script from anywhere.

I'm a newbee so the script is really simple and probably holds a lot off error, so feel free to make it better :-)
